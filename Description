It is Rock, Paper, Scissor game in which the user will select Rock, Paper or Scissor as their choice and then the computer will randomly generate any choice from the Rock, Paper or Scissor.
In this code I use
     i) The 'random' function to generate the random output for the computer.
     ii) The 'scanner' function to take the input from the user as their choice.
     iii) String comparison (with equalsIgnoreCase()) to compare the player’s and computer’s choices.
     iv) Logical conditions (if-else statements) to determine the winner.
